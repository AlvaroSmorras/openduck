# Welcome to OpenDUck

OpenDUck is an opensource implementation of Dynamic Undocking. Dynamic Undocking (DUck) is a particular implementation of steered molecular dynamics developed as a fast algorithm to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state at which a certain netive contact is broken between the ligand and receptor. Due to its cheap and fast nature, DUck is mainly employed as a post-docking filter during virtual screening campaings.

## Installation

### Conda

Make a fresh Conda environment, notice conda might take long time to resolve it I don't know why.
```{bash}
$ git clone git@github.com:CBDD/openduck.git
$ cd openduck
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml 
$ conda activate openduck
$ python setup.py install
```

## OpenDUck usage

Openduck can be used as a python library or as an executable. The executable provided is openduck, which is set up an entry point in the path. Alternatively you can use the openduck.py in scripts.

Openduck comes with several submodules to launch the different steps of Dynamic Undocking

```{bash}
$ conda activate openduck

$ openduck -h

usage: openduck [-h]  ...

Open Dynamic Undocking

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Open Dynamic Undocking toolkit. Choose one of the following actions:
  
    OpenMM_prepare      
                        Preparation of systems for OpenMM simulations
    OpenMM_full-protocol
                        OpenDuck OpenMM full protocol either with or without chunking the protein.

```

Each of the OpenDUck modules accepts the input either as command line arguments or in a yaml file.
The arguments in the input.yaml are expected to follow the command-line nomenclature.

### Running OpenDUck in OpenMM

The openMM implementation of OpenDUck is divided in two steps, the preparation using openmm_forcefields and the production (MD/SMD) following the Dynamic Undocking protocol.
During the preparation step, the protein is reduced to the pocket during the _chunking_ step, then the ligand and receptor are parametrized with the specified forcefields and the solvation box is generated.
After equilibration, the sequential MD/SMD simulations, sampling and steering the main interaction from the specified distances, are produced in OpenMM.

The openMM submodules are setup to allow independent usage of the previously mentioned steps:

    * OpenMM_full-protocol: Executes the full OpenDuck protocol, from the protein-ligand files to the Steered simulations
    * OpenMM_prepare: Executes exclusively the preparation and equilibration of the protein-ligand complex
    * OpenMM_from-equilibrated: Executes exclusively the production of MD/SMD runs from an equilibrated input.
    * OpenMM_from-amber: Starts the openDuck simulations from an amber topology.

Similarly, an execution with the input parameters in a yaml is also possible (the example has slightly different parameters as the command line, just for ilustration purposes ).
```{bash}
openduck OpenMM_full-protocol -y input.yaml

### Running OpenDUck in Amber

Originally Dynamic Undocking was designed to run in Amber, in OpenDUck we have maintained the same protocol for AMBER, replacing the parametrization and file-generation previously done by MOE with an open implementation. Similarly as with the old protocol, freedom on the quequeing headers and preparation are integrated both in the commandline arguments and in the input yaml.
Preparation flags are very similar to those for OpenMM, as most of the implementation is shared.

```{bash}
$ openduck AMBER_prepare -l ../1a28_lig.mol -r ../1a28_prot.pdb -i A_ARG_766_NH2 --do-chunk -c 10 -b False -f GAFF2 -ff amber99sb -w SPCE -ion 0.05 -s 11 --HMR -n 4 -W 4 -q Slurm
```

Tipically, we Dynamic Undocking is employed as a post-docking filter in a virtual screening campaign. As such, multiple ligands might be generated at the time. A batch execution of the DUck preparation can be executed specifying the _--batch_ argument and giving an sdf file with multiple ligands as input. Each ligand and the associated file structure will be generated in the LIG_target_{n} subfolder where n is the ligand's position in the sdf.

```{bash}
$ openduck AMBER_prepare -l ../brd4_ligands.sdf -r ../4LR6_aligned_chunk_nowat.pdb -i A_ASN_140_ND2 --waters-to-retain ../waters_to_retain.pdb -f gaff2 -ff amber14-all -w spce -ion 1 -s 30 --HMR --smd-cycles 10 -wqb-threshold 8 -q SGE --seed 1235467890 --batch --threads 8
```

The queueing template is stored in duck/templates/queueing_templates. To customize a template, a new file can be added in the directory with the following format: {queue_name}_array.q or {queue_name}.q either if the expected execution is in an array or not. For a local execution, the _local_ argument can be given for a plain list of commands.

The templates have the following format:
```
#!/bin/bash
#HEADER

{functions}

{commands}
```

### Analysis

After the successfully running openDUck in either openMM or Amber, compiling the results can be performed using the report submodule.
By default, the lowest $W_{QB}$ is used as a reporter for the robustness of the studied interaction, however, a better (and more formally appropiate) descriptor has been shown to be the $\Delta_{QB}$ obtained using the Jarzynski equality. When specified, a bootstrapping is performed to assess the convergence of the reported value.

**important**

Due the different formating of Amber and OpenMM steered molecular dynamics output, the _--format_ argument is needed when analyzing either output.
When analyzing a single result, the default pattern is the current directory (.). If multiple directories are ment to be analysed, specify the wildcard pattern.

```{bash}
$ openduck report -h

usage: openduck report [-h] [-p PATTERN] [-d {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}] [-o OUTPUT] [-of {csv,sdf,tbl}] [--plot] [-s SUBSAMPLE_SIZE] [-i ITERATIONS] [-t STEP_THRESHOLD] [-f {amber,openmm}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Wildcard pattern to find folders with DUck data
  -d {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}, --data {min,single,avg,jarzynski,all}
                        Mode to compile the report [min | single | avg | jarzynski | all]
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file, default is printing report to stdout.
  -of {csv,sdf,tbl}, --output-format {csv,sdf,tbl}
                        Output format, [csv | sdf | tbl].
  --plot                Plot work or energy values to file.
  -s SUBSAMPLE_SIZE, --subsample-size SUBSAMPLE_SIZE
                        Subsample size for jarzynski bootstrapping.

  -f {amber,openmm}, --format {amber,openmm}
                        Data where the results come from. Amber by default.
```
